While previous studies have focused on econometric analysis, few have positioned the mixed treatment problem within the realm of causal machine learning, particularly in uplift modeling. This study proposes a novel uplift modeling technique called weighted doubly robust learning, which uses Shapley-value treatment attribution and doubly robust estimation to control for confounding among different treatments and estimate the pure effect for each treatment. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic dataset and industrial dataset. The results show that our method outperforms most of the current uplift modeling approaches in responsive customer targeting and effective treatment attribution, achieving an area under uplift curve (AUUC) of 0.590 and a Qini-coefficient of 0.080. Our method not only contributes to advancing current causal machine learning methods, but also provides valuable insights for companies in business decision making.","tags":["Marketing"],"title":"Weighted doubly robust learning An uplift modeling technique for estimating mixed treatments' effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sihan Li","Yongli LI","Chao Liu （刘 超）","Ningyuan Fan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1678320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678320000,"objectID":"8df4febfaf6799e711ebd80b2fefc51a","permalink":"https://liuchaos03.github.io/en/publication/how-do-different-types-of-user-generated-content-attract-travelers-taking-story-and-review-on-airbnb-as-the-example/","publishdate":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/how-do-different-types-of-user-generated-content-attract-travelers-taking-story-and-review-on-airbnb-as-the-example/","section":"publication","summary":"User-generated content (UGC) has been validated as an important factor in travel decisions.

As a platform designed only for posting negative comments, its effect on firms’ sales would be different with the traditional online reviews that allow both positive and negative comments. To this end, this work aims to unveil how the public complaint platform affects the corresponding firms’ sales. Interestingly, both the feedback theory and the negative word-of-mouth theory can answer the research question, but they achieve opposite results. Then, this work designed three gradually deepening studies to determine which theory dominates based on our elaborately collected data from the Heimao platform. The first one is to design a quasi-natural experiment by regarding the platform usage as a treatment and adopt the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Differences Model (DID) to investigate which theory dominates, the second one is to reveal the mechanism of the mixed effect of the two theories and unveil how the two theories take effect, during which we developed the Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network (LSTM) and a network-based model to deal with the challenge of measuring the explanatory variables of reflecting the two theories, and the third one is to consider the firm type as the moderating variable to fulfill the results about the effect mechanism. Accordingly, we find that (1) the feedback theory dominates in our collected dataset, (2) the feedback theory takes a moderating effect and can offset the negative impact of online word-of-mouth; (3) firm type affects the strength of the moderating effect of the feedback theory. This work also contributes to providing insights on optimizing the complaint platform’s operation and the firm’s complaint management.","tags":["Marketing"],"title":"The Effect of Consumer Complaints on Firm Sales, New Evidence from a Public Complaint Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongli LI","Chao Liu （刘 超）","Chuang Wei","Xiaochen Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671235200,"objectID":"d88463d17042b124a03691a1f70537d4","permalink":"https://liuchaos03.github.io/en/publication/referral-strategy-based-on-social-network-incentive/","publishdate":"2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/referral-strategy-based-on-social-network-incentive/","section":"publication","summary":"Customers’ social network is often regarded as a valuable capital for companies and individuals.

Because of the complicated cross-bank loan and concealed influence relationship in related loans, it is difficult for banks to identify related loans and take effective measures. Based on the loan guarantee data of several commercial banks, this paper constructs a multi-layer complex network, then designs an algorithm to identify the related loan structure and analyzes the effectiveness; the default rate of different related loans structures is calculated and compared with 4 risk indicators; finally, the significance of default risk of different related loans structures is tested. The results shows, (1) The multi-layer network related loan model and the recognition algorithm constructed in this paper greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of related loan identification, and overcome the dual concealed problem of related loans that cannot be solved by the single layer network; (2) The betweenness and clustering coefficient indicators are more consistent with the true default rate of related loans, while the indicators based on the clearing payment capacity and risk distance fail to predict the true default rate; (3) when there are circle-linked structure and sink structure in related loans network, the default risk of loans increase significantly. The model and method constructed in this paper provide theoretical basis to identify multi-bank and multi relationship related loans, and have practical significance for banks to detect risk network structures and to control related loan risks.","tags":["Finance"],"title":"Risk Identification Model of Related Loans Based on Analysis of Multi-layer Complex Network Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongli LI","Tianchen Wang","Baiqing Sun","Chao Liu （刘 超）"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653004800,"objectID":"0cfd60965ba1df2a8cd0b9f777da48d4","permalink":"https://liuchaos03.github.io/en/publication/detecting-the-leadlag-efect-in-stock/","publishdate":"2022-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/detecting-the-leadlag-efect-in-stock/","section":"publication","summary":"Human activities widely exhibit a power-law distribution. Considering stock trading as a typical human activity in the financial domain, the first aim of this paper is to validate whether the well-known power-law distribution can be observed in this activity. Interestingly, this paper determines that the number of accumulated lead–lag days between stock pairs meets the power-law distribution in both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets based on 10 years of trading data. Based on this finding this paper adopts the power-law distribution to formally define the lead–lag effect, detect stock pairs with the lead–lag effect, and then design a pure lead–lag investment strategy as well as enhancement investment strategies by integrating the lead–lag strategy into classic alpha-factor strategies. Tests conducted on 20 different alpha-factor strategies demonstrate that both perform better than the selected benchmark strategy and that the lead–lag strategy provides useful signals that significantly improve the performance of basic alpha-factor strategies. Our results therefore indicate that the lead–lag effect may provide effective information for designing more profitable investment strategies.","tags":["Finance"],"title":"Detecting the lead–lag efect in stock markets: defnition, patterns, and investment strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongli LI","Chao Liu （刘 超）","Hanjun Zhang","Qiang Ye"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640217600,"objectID":"1c4116f121fc35fbe304b1fb53c20de4","permalink":"https://liuchaos03.github.io/en/publication/network-analysis-technologies-for-policy-informatics-and-policy-intelligence/","publishdate":"2021-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/network-analysis-technologies-for-policy-informatics-and-policy-intelligence/","section":"publication","summary":"Policy informatics and policy intelligence have gradually developed into a new interdiscipline, needing to integrate the techniques, models and analytical methods of multiple disciplines in its birth and development.

To this end, a series of statistical analyses is conducted to find that the (longest) successive lead-lag days satisfy a power law distribution in the two mainland stock markets in China, which answers the question regarding the dynamic pattern. Note that the heavy tail of the power-law distribution is the core of the discovered dynamic pattern. A formal and solid definition of the lead-lag effect is provided by statistical testing, and then the corresponding detection method is designed and applied to obtain the heavy tail. Finally, an empirical study of the detected stocks with lead-lag effect is further conducted via an exponential random graph model (ERGM). Our work adds new knowledge to the lead-lag phenomenon in the financial domain, provides a formal definition of the lead-lag effect and proposes anew detection method benefiting future studies on the lead-lag relationship in financial markets.

The Research on the Value Measurement Model of Social Network and Its Application in Recommendation Strategies establishes a general model framework to measure the value of social network based on the monopoly market by considering the changes in the welfare level of market participants caused by network effects. Based on this framework, the values of \"nodes\", \"links\" and \"structures\", which are the elements of the network, are measured respectively, and the analytic solutions of the value measurement of various elements are given, the relevant attribute principles are deduced and the relevant laws affecting the value of various elements are explored.

Starting from the feature analysis of the crowdfunding pattern, this paper takes the characteristics of network externality and the structure of perfect monopoly market as the breakthrough point, then proposes the value measurement model of network externality of crowdfunding platform. This model is based on the crowdfunding initiator's revenue function and the consumer utility function which considers the macro and micro network externality. By establishing a two-stage game model, the optimal price vectors of crowdfunding initiators, the optimal purchase quantity of participants and the optimal income level of crowdfunding initiators are solved respectively in the cases of differential pricing strategy, single uniform price strategy and benchmark model without network externality. Then the strategic value and intrinsic value of network externality of crowdfunding platform are obtained by comparing the optimal returns of crowdfunding initiators using different strategies. In addition, the theoretical results of the model are applied to the special structure of referral network, and a crowdfunding platform with recommendation function is designed. These results show that the designed crowdfunding platform with the recommendation function in this paper can encourage participants to recommend more people to join in the crowdfunding project, and can greatly raise the initiator’s income level. To sum up, the proposed model and method is significant for crowdfunding initiators to raise their income levels so as to be meaningful in improving the marketing modes in real crowdfunding platforms.","tags":["Marketing"],"title":"Value measurement model of network externality in a crowdfunding platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
